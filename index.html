        <h2>Above All</h2>
    <h5 class="violet-subtitle">by Michael W. Smith</h5>
    <p>Above all powers
        Above all kings
        Above all nature and all created things
        Above all wisdom and all the ways of man
        You were here before the world began
    </p>
    <p>Above all kingdoms
        Above all thrones
        Above all wonders the world has ever known
        Above all wealth and treasures of the earth
        There's no way to measure what you're worth
    </p>
    <p>
        Crucified
        Laid behind the stone
        You lived to die
        Rejected and alone
    </p>
